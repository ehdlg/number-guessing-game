# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a simple CLI-based Python program. In this game, the player has to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The number of attempts allowed is determined by the chosen difficulty level. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

This program is part of a backend project from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game). The goal of this project is to continue learning Python by working on a straightforward application. By developing this simple game, I aim to familiarize myself with Python and
its syntax.

## Features

- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy (10 chances), Medium (5 chances), or Hard (3 chances).
- **Guess Feedback**: Get hints on whether the target number is greater or less than your guess.
- **Game End**: The game will end when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
